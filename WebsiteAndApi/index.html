				<h2>What is DevSpace</h2>
				<p>
					DevSpace is an annual developer's conference that takes place in Huntsville, Alabama.
					Fueled by extensive space and missile research and a vibrant, emerging start-up culture, Huntsville is a
					market poised and ready to burst onto the national stage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Technological interests run the gamut of every language.
					As such, DevSpace aims to cater to this entire atmosphere.
					DevSpace wants to offer talks on a variety of languages, offering attendees the ability to improve their
					skills within their daily technology of choice and the ability to become familiar with new technologies.
					Combine this with non-technical talks on inter-personal skills and processes, DevSpace will provide an
					outstanding value to the attendees.

				<h2>Changes to DevSpace 2021</h2>
				<p>
					As we mentioned when we announced DevSpace 2021, we were tentative on our in-person event based on the state
					of the COVID-19 pandemic.
					At the point we announced our in-person conference, things seemed to be trending in the right direction.
					With the new delta variant surging and the current state of North Alabama, we are no longer comfortable
					holding the in-person event.
				</p>
				<p>
					Link last year, the conference will be hosted on our twitch channel at <a
						href="https://www.twitch.tv/devspaceconf">https://www.twitch.tv/devspaceconf</a>.
					However, unlike last year, we will be accepting submissions for the conference.
					As our <a href="./speakers.html">call for speakers</a> has already been open, those who have already submitted
					sessions for the in-person event will get priority.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are still working with our partners to make this change, so please be a little patient with us.
					We will update this site and our social platforms with more information as we solidify the details.

				<h2>Dates for 2021 Announced</h2>
				<p>
					This year, the DevSpace Technical Conference will take place on September 9th and 10th.
					We will continue to be in the South Hall Ballrooms of the Von Braun Center.
					We have moved the dates from our traditional Friday and Saturday to Thursday and Friday.
					This was not a decision we took lightly.
				</p>
				<p>
					We posted an informal poll in several locations, such as on our Twitter account and various Slack groups.
					The split between people who enjoyed Friday and Saturday was dead split with people we did not want to attend
					a conference on a weekend.
					The biggest rationale for this was the belief that weekends should be for family.
					While we have plans to include a family track in the future, we currently do not have the budget to include
					that track.
					As such, we have decided to try a Thursday and Friday conference.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have also moved earlier into the year, opting for a September conference over our traditional October
					timing.
					Our primary reasoning for this came down to scheduling with the Von Braun Center.
					It can be difficult to find times that are available at the VBC.
					While we loved our mid-October time frame, we realize that we usually fell on top of fall break for all the
					local school systems.
					We had heard from many people that they usually make plans with thier families for vacations during this time.
				</p>
				<p>
					For those curious, we were given the option to have September 10th and 11th, and decided on the 9th and 10th
					as a combination of the two factors mentioned above.
					Besides, September 11th is a Saturday in college football season.
					We were tired of competing against that, anyway.

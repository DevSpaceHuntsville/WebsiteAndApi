				<h2>Sponsorships and Exhibitor Spaces Available</h2>
				<p>
					We are currently accepting sponsorships and exhibitor spaces for our 2021 conference.
					You can find all the details in our <a
						href="https://devspacesponsorstorage.blob.core.windows.net/files/2021/devspace-prospectus.pdf"
						target="_blank">Sponsorship Prospectus</a>.

				<h2>Donations to DevSpace</h2>
				<p>
					There are two options to donate through the buttons on the right.
					If you use the PayPay Giving Fund button (which is the top one,) you must have a PayPal account to send funds.
					However, donations received through there have no fees and We get 100% of the money you donate.
					You will also receive a receipt to make your donation tax-deductible.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you use the PayPay Direct button (which is the bottom one,) you can make a direct payment without a PayPal
					account.
					This method also has the added bonus of releasing the funds to us quicker, but you won't get an instant receipt
					and we will get charged all the fees.
					If you include an email address on your donation, we'll reach out to you to produce a receipt.
					If you do not, then you'll need to email us with the transaction Id.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					We're so serious about this, that we have completely revamped the sponsor page for our site.
					Every person that contributes (that we can manage to track) will get listed in some way on the sponsor page.
					Once we figure out who you are, we'll get you added to the database.
					Depending on how much you donate, you'll get the following perks:
				</p>
	
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Amazing Sponsor</th>
						<td>Over $500</td>
						<td>
							Large image added to this page<br />
							Small image added to sidebar on right<br />
							Small image displayed in rotator on stream for 60 second intervals
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Special Sponsor</th>
						<td>$300 - $499.99</td>
						<td>
							Large image added to this page<br />
							Small image displayed in rotator on stream for 30 second intervals
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Image Sponsor</th>
						<td>$150 - $299.99</td>
						<td>
							Small image added to this page<br />
							Small image displayed in rotator on stream for 15 second intervals
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Link Sponsor</th>
						<td>$50 - $149.99</td>
						<td>Link added to name</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Sponsor</th>
						<td>Under $50</td>
						<td>Name displayed on page</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					Well, I guess while we're at it, there are a few other places you can use to help us out.
					We're listed in Humble Bundle, so you can request some of your purchases there go to us.
					We're also registered with AmazonSmile.
					I believe you have to look us up with our "legal entity name," which is DevSpace Huntsville.
